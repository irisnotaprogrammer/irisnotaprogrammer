- 👋 Hi, I’m @irisnotaprogrammer
- 👀 I’m interested in photography, video, video editing, 3D design, 3D printing, electronics and woodworking.  On top of all of that, a little bit of game development, but mostly in the 3D design of a map.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to speed up the process of designing a map of my own city for OMSI, a German-made bussimulator in which I've been building my city ever since 2012 or 2013, though development did start earlier.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on well...maybe something, I'm not sure if it's collaboration what I'm wanting to do with GitHub.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on Instagram or Youtube.  I have a website but that's a Dutch-only website so maybe not as of much use.
